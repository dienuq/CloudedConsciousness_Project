# Clouded_Consciousness
 This project uses sand as a communication medium to explore the realms of deep embedded data and information stored in the cloud via using different internet tools (from simply browsing the internet, to using different online platforms and machine learning algorithms). By writing in the sand snippets of information that are usually stored in the cloud, like online activity or internet searches, users can connect with their archetype and explore a personalized interplay of projected mandalas, generated by AI. 

Workflow:

1. Approach the Installation: approaching the art installation, visitors will notice a tablet attached to the lightbox, featuring a futuristic aesthetic.

2. Tablet Interaction: interacting with the tablet reveals instructions on how to engage with the art installation. The user is prompted to write down a word or phrase in the sand on the lightbox.

3. User Input: participants write their chosen word or phrase directly onto the lightbox surface, using the black sand (Appendix 4).

4. Analyze Button: after completing their inscription, users press the "Analyze" button on the tablet.

5. Communication with PC: the tablet communicates with the PC via OSC messages, triggering the webcam to capture a photo of the lightbox.

6. Image Processing on PC: on the PC, a Python algorithm processes the webcam photo through several steps: grayscale conversion, binarization with threshold, image inversion (essential for text detection trained on black text on a white background)

7. OCR Text Recognition: utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR), the algorithm extracts the text from the processed image and stores it in a variable.

8. Prompt Generation and API Interaction: the variable containing the recognized text is introduced to a predefined prompt. The Python script then interfaces with the ChatGPT API, generating a response corresponding to the identified archetype (for more details, see Appendix 5).

9. Archetype Display on Tablet: the PC sends an OSC message to the tablet, instructing it to display the description of the selected archetype. This provides users with insights into the characteristics and meaning associated with their input. 

10. Mandala and Sound FX Selection: simultaneously, the PC sends additional OSC messages to select the desired mandala design and the corresponding Sound FX associated with the archetype (this is done in Touchdesigner).

11. Mandala Projection: the chosen mandala design is projected onto the smaller ring in the sand on the floor, contributing to the immersive visual experience
