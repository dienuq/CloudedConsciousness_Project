# Clouded_Consciousness
 This project uses sand as a communication medium to explore the realms of deep embedded data and information stored in the cloud via using different internet tools (from simply browsing the internet, to using different online platforms and machine learning algorithms). By writing in the sand snippets of information that are usually stored in the cloud, like online activity or internet searches, users can connect with their archetype and explore a personalized interplay of projected mandalas, generated by AI.
